# Project Progress Update: Claude Code for Emacs

## Completed Features

### Core Functionality
- [x] **Multiple Claude buffer support** - Manage multiple Claude sessions efficiently
- [x] **Auto-response system** - Automatically respond to different prompt types (y/n, y/y/n, waiting)
- [x] **State detection** - Detect Claude's current state for smart interaction

### User Experience Improvements
- [x] **Notification system** - Bell/visual alerts when Claude needs input
  - Multiple notification methods (audible, visual, external command)
  - Configurable settings for different prompt types
  - Mode-line flashing to draw attention
- [x] **Visual aids** - Visual indicators for different Claude states
- [x] **Eye-friendly features** - Reduce eye strain during long Claude sessions
  - Smooth scrolling with speed control
  - Update throttling to control refresh rate
  - Visual indicators for scrolling speed
- [x] **Font size management** - Buffer-specific font size controls
  - Increase/decrease with keyboard (C-c C-+, C-c C--)
  - Mouse wheel support (Ctrl+wheel)
  - Reset to default (C-c C-0)
- [x] **Color themes** - Customizable colors optimized for readability
  - Dark theme (black background, off-white text)
  - Light theme (white background, black text)
  - Gray theme (dark gray background, light gray text)
- [x] **Line number toggle** - Hide/show line numbers in vterm buffers

### Advanced Features
- [x] **Interaction tracking** - Count and log interactions with Claude
  - Statistics display with timestamps
  - Relative timing information
- [x] **Periodic commands** - Send commands at specified intervals
  - Support for multiple commands with different intervals
  - Default /compact and /git commands
  - Customizable command list and intervals

### Developer Features
- [x] **Comprehensive tests** - Ensure reliability of all components
- [x] **Customization options** - User-configurable settings for all features
- [x] **Documentation** - Detailed help and usage information

## Project Organization
- [x] **Modular design** - Well-organized code with clear separation of concerns
- [x] **Version control** - Git integration for tracking changes
- [x] **Example usage** - Simplified examples for common use cases

## Next Steps

### High Priority
- [ ] **Yank as file** - Streamlined file creation from buffer content
- [ ] **More visual indicators** - Enhanced status display in mode line
- [ ] **Buffer visibility improvements** - Better buffer switching and management

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Performance optimizations** - Further speed improvements for large outputs
- [ ] **Extended keyboard shortcuts** - More convenient command access
- [ ] **Integration with existing Emacs features** - Better interoperability

### Low Priority
- [ ] **Additional themes** - More color options for different environments
- [ ] **Command history management** - Track and reuse previous commands
- [ ] **Context-aware help** - Situation-specific assistance

## Technical Debt
- [ ] **Refactor auto-response system** - Improve code organization
- [ ] **Standardize naming conventions** - Ensure consistent naming
- [ ] **Add missing docstrings** - Complete documentation for all functions

## Current Status

The project has made significant progress, with all core functionality and many user experience improvements already implemented. The focus has been on creating a comfortable, efficient environment for interacting with Claude in Emacs.

All tests are passing (100% success rate), and the code organization has been improved with a more modular structure. The next phase will focus on implementing the remaining planned features and refining the existing functionality.
