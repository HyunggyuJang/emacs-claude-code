# Development Plan - Phase 3: Auto-Response Reliability
Date: 2025-05-31

## 1. Project Description
Enhance the emacs-claude-code auto-response system to be more reliable, predictable, and user-friendly. Focus on solving timing issues and improving state management.

## 2. Goals
- **Primary**: Achieve 99%+ reliability in auto-response command sending
- **Secondary**: Improve debugging and monitoring capabilities
- **Tertiary**: Enhance user experience with better visual feedback

## 3. Milestones

### Milestone 1: Core Reliability (2 weeks)
**Goal**: Fix all timing and send verification issues

Tasks:
- [ ] Implement state-based send verification
- [ ] Add prompt empty detection
- [ ] Create retry mechanism for failed sends
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging for debugging
- [ ] Write tests for all edge cases

### Milestone 2: Safety Architecture (1 week)
**Goal**: Centralize and improve safety mechanisms

Tasks:
- [ ] Create centralized keyword detection system
- [ ] Implement multi-layer safety checks
- [ ] Add user-configurable safety keywords
- [ ] Document all safety mechanisms
- [ ] Add safety override options for advanced users

### Milestone 3: UI/UX Improvements (1 week)
**Goal**: Better visibility and control

Tasks:
- [ ] Implement multi-buffer dashboard view
- [ ] Add visual send status indicators
- [ ] Create buffer name enhancements
- [ ] Add pause/resume all functionality
- [ ] Improve mode-line indicators

### Milestone 4: Testing & Documentation (3 days)
**Goal**: Ensure robustness and usability

Tasks:
- [ ] Create integration tests for auto-response
- [ ] Write user guide for auto-response features
- [ ] Document troubleshooting procedures
- [ ] Create demo videos/screenshots
- [ ] Update README with new features

## 4. Technical Approach

### State Machine Enhancement
```
IDLE → DETECTING → SENDING → VERIFYING → COMPLETE
                      ↓
                   RETRYING
```

### New Variables Structure
```elisp
--ecc-auto-response-state       ; Current state
--ecc-auto-response-keywords    ; Centralized keywords
--ecc-auto-response-history     ; Send history for debugging
```

## 5. Success Criteria
- No timer errors in 24-hour continuous operation
- All auto-responses sent successfully on first attempt (95%+)
- Clear visual feedback for all states
- Zero false positives in safety checks

## 6. Risk Mitigation
- Backward compatibility with existing configs
- Gradual rollout with feature flags
- Extensive testing before merge
- Easy rollback mechanism

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Create feature branch: `feature/auto-response-reliability`
2. Start with state-based verification implementation
3. Set up comprehensive logging system
