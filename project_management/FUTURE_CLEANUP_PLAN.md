# Future Cleanup Plan

This document outlines the next steps for further code cleanup and organization in the Emacs Claude Code project.

## 1. Filename Standardization

Now that we've begun standardizing filenames by removing development-stage suffixes, we should continue this effort:

### Auto-Response Module
- Rename remaining auto-response files with development-stage suffixes
- Consolidate overlapping functionality
- Update all references to standardized names

### State Detection Module
- Rename remaining state-detection files with development-stage suffixes
- Ensure consistent naming patterns
- Update all references

### Buffer Management Module
- Review buffer-related files for naming consistency
- Standardize interface for buffer operations
- Update documentation

## 2. Code Organization

Further improvements to code organization:

### Modular Structure
- Continue organizing code into logical functional groups
- Ensure clear separation of concerns
- Reduce dependencies between modules

### API Consistency
- Standardize function naming across modules
- Ensure consistent parameter ordering
- Provide clear docstrings for all public functions

## 3. Documentation Enhancement

Improve documentation coverage and quality:

### Module Documentation
- Add detailed documentation for each major module
- Include usage examples and integration notes
- Document configuration options

### Architecture Documentation
- Expand overall architecture documentation
- Create visual diagrams showing component relationships
- Document key design patterns and decisions

## 4. Testing Improvements

Enhance test coverage and quality:

### Test Organization
- Standardize test naming and structure
- Ensure tests exist for all key functionality
- Add integration tests for module interactions

### Test Documentation
- Document test purposes and coverage
- Add examples of how to run specific test suites
- Document test dependencies and assumptions

## 5. Removing Obsolete Code

Further removal of obsolete code:

### Dead Code Elimination
- Identify and remove unused functions
- Remove commented-out code sections
- Archive superseded functionality

### Dependency Cleanup
- Remove unnecessary dependencies
- Consolidate redundant functionality
- Reduce the overall footprint

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Focus | Timeline |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Complete current filename cleanup PRs | May 21-25, 2025 |
| 2 | Auto-response module cleanup | May 26-30, 2025 |
| 3 | State detection module cleanup | June 1-5, 2025 |
| 4 | Buffer management module cleanup | June 6-10, 2025 |
| 5 | Documentation enhancements | June 11-20, 2025 |

## Success Criteria

The cleanup effort will be considered successful when:

1. All files follow standardized naming conventions
2. All modules have comprehensive documentation
3. Test coverage exceeds 90% for core functionality
4. No redundant or duplicated functionality exists
5. Code organization follows clear design principles

## Tracking Progress

Progress will be tracked using:

1. Weekly progress reports
2. PR reviews and merge reports
3. Test coverage metrics
4. Documentation completeness checks
