  - Test performance in complex operations

## Consolidation Benefits

The module consolidation efforts have yielded significant benefits:

1. **Reduced Code Size:** Eliminating duplicate implementations has reduced the codebase size
2. **Improved Documentation:** All functions now have comprehensive docstrings
3. **Enhanced Architecture:** Cleaner interfaces between modules
4. **Better Testing:** Comprehensive test coverage for consolidated modules
5. **Simplified Maintenance:** Single implementation of each feature
6. **Clearer APIs:** Consistent function naming and parameters
7. **Better Error Handling:** Comprehensive error checking and reporting
8. **Enhanced Features:** Support for both global and buffer-local operation

## Conclusion

The module consolidation process is making excellent progress, with six major modules now consolidated and enhanced. The clear architecture and improved documentation will make maintenance and future development much easier. The next steps focus on consolidating the remaining core modules to complete the cleanup process.

The consolidated modules provide a solid foundation for the emacs-claude-code project, with clean interfaces, comprehensive documentation, and robust testing. This will enable more efficient development and better user experience in the future.

## Wrapper Module Approach

For modules that are already consolidated in their main implementation files (like state detection and debug utilities), we've established a consistent approach:

1. Keep the main implementation in a file with `-consolidated` suffix
2. Create a lightweight wrapper module with the original name
3. The wrapper module requires the consolidated implementation
4. The wrapper provides only the original feature name
5. Add clear documentation explaining the wrapper's purpose

This approach ensures:
- Consistent naming across the project
- Clean backward compatibility
- No code duplication
- Clear understanding of the module's purpose
- Simplified migration for code using different module names
