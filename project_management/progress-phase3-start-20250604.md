# Progress: Phase 3 Start - Auto-Response Reliability
Date: 2025-06-04

## Current Status
- All tests passing (97/97, 100% success rate)
- Yank-as-file feature implemented with SSH support
- State detection tests fixed
- Repository clean and up to date

## Phase 3 Focus: Auto-Response Reliability
Starting implementation of Phase 3 as planned. Primary goal is to achieve 99%+ reliability in auto-response command sending.

## Today's Plan
1. Begin Milestone 1: Core Reliability
2. Start with state-based send verification
3. Add comprehensive logging for debugging

## Next Steps
- [ ] Analyze current auto-response implementation
- [ ] Identify potential timing issues
- [ ] Design state-based verification system
- [ ] Implement improved logging
