# Feature Request: Multi-Buffer Split View for Claude Sessions

## Summary
Create interactive ways to view multiple Claude sessions in a vertically split window layout, either through buffer list selection or dedicated commands.

## Description
When working with multiple Claude sessions that have auto-response enabled, it would be helpful to have a dedicated view that shows all active auto-responding sessions simultaneously. This would allow users to monitor multiple automated conversations at once.

## Proposed Implementation

### Option A: Interactive Tab Creation from Buffer List
- In the buffer list, allow selecting multiple buffers (mark with 'm' key)
- Add command to create a new tab from selected buffers
- Display selected buffers in vertical splits within the new tab
- More flexible - users can create custom views with any combination of buffers

### Option B: Dedicated Auto-Response Command
- Create a command like `ecc-show-auto-response-dashboard`
- Automatically finds all buffers with auto-response enabled
- Creates a new tab/frame with vertical splits
- Can be bound to a key for quick access (e.g., `C-c C-a d`)

### Option C: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
1. **From Buffer List**: Mark buffers and press 'T' to create tab with splits
2. **Quick Command**: `ecc-auto-response-dashboard` for instant auto-response view
3. **Features for both**:
   - Live updates as buffers change state
   - Visual indicators for activity
   - Click to focus specific buffer
   - Commands to pause/resume all at once

## Benefits
- Better oversight of multiple automated sessions
- Easy monitoring of parallel Claude interactions
- Quick access to intervene when needed
- Improved workflow for users managing multiple tasks

## Technical Considerations
- Integration with existing `ecc-list` module
- Need to track auto-response state across buffers
- Window management for dynamic vertical splits
- Performance with many active sessions
- Consider leveraging `emacs-tab-manager` (at `~/.emacs.d/lisp/emacs-tab-manager`) for tab functionality

## Priority
Medium - This is a quality-of-life improvement for power users

## Related Components
- `ecc-list.el` - Buffer list implementation
- `ecc-auto-response.el` - Auto-response functionality
