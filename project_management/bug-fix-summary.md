# Bug Fix Summary

## Bug Reports Created

1. **Auto-Response Timer Error**
   - Bug: When the auto-response timer (`ecc-check-and-respond`) runs, it throws a "wrong number of arguments" error
   - File: `/project_management/bug-report-auto-response-timer-error.md`
   - Root cause: The advice function `ecc-check-and-respond-advised` was defined with an `orig-fun` parameter, but it was applied using `:override` advice, which doesn't pass the original function.

2. **ESC Key Not Working**
   - Bug: ESC key doesn't work to interrupt Claude in vterm mode
   - File: `/project_management/bug-report-esc-key-not-working.md`
   - Root cause: The ESC key binding wasn't properly set up with both keyboard representations (`[escape]` and `"\e"`)

## Fixes Implemented

1. **Fixed Auto-Response Timer Error**
   - Modified `ecc-check-and-respond-advised` to remove the unnecessary `orig-fun` parameter
   - Updated docstring to clarify it's an override implementation, not an advice that calls the original function
   - Updated tests to ensure the function works correctly

2. **Improved ESC Key Handling**
   - Modified `ecc-setup-esc-key-in-vterm` to bind both `[escape]` and `"\e"` key representations
   - Added binding for `ecc-term-claude-mode-map` as well
   - Added hooks to ensure the bindings are set up when either vterm or our mode is loaded

## Other Improvements

1. **Enhanced Tests**
   - Added tests for checking `ecc-check-and-respond-advised` can be called without arguments
   - The tests verify that the auto-response system works correctly with throttling

## Verification

- All tests are now passing
- The auto-response timer function works correctly without throwing errors
- ESC key binding setup has been improved with multiple binding methods

## Next Steps

1. Test in real-world usage
2. Verify these fixes resolve issues where:
   - Auto-response stopped unexpectedly during use
   - ESC key didn't work to interrupt Claude

These fixes will improve the reliability and usability of the auto-response system.
