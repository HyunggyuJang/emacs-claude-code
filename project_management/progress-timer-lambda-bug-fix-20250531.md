# Progress Report: Timer Lambda Bug Fix
Date: 2025-05-31

## Summary
Fixed critical timer lambda argument mismatch errors that were occurring when enabling auto-response mode.

## Work Completed

### Bug Fixed
- **Issue**: Timer errors with message `wrong-number-of-arguments` when enabling auto-response
- **Root Cause**: Lambda functions in timers were not properly accepting buffer arguments
- **Solution**: Modified lambda functions to accept buffer parameters explicitly

### Files Modified
1. `src/ecc-auto-response.el` (line 177)
   - Fixed lambda in `--ecc-auto-response-enable-buffer` function
   
2. `src/ecc-notification.el` (line 127)
   - Fixed lambda in `--ecc-notification--flash-mode-line` function

### Testing
- All 91 tests pass successfully
- No syntax errors
- Timer functions now execute without errors

### Documentation
- Created detailed bug report: `bug-report-timer-lambda-argument-mismatch.md`
- Moved to solved directory after fix completion

## Impact
This fix resolves a high-priority issue that was causing errors every time auto-response was enabled, improving the stability of core functionality.

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any similar timer-related issues
- Consider reviewing other timer usage patterns in the codebase
