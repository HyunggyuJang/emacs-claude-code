# Emacs Claude Code Architecture

## Overview
This document describes the architecture of the Emacs Claude Code project, highlighting the current state of development and the relationships between different components. The architecture is designed to provide a modular and extensible framework for interacting with Claude AI within Emacs.

## Core Components

### Term Claude Mode (Complete)
The fundamental mode for Claude interaction within terminal buffers, providing specialized commands and keybindings for effective communication with the AI assistant.

### Auto Response System (Complete)
Detects specific Claude prompts and automatically responds to them, streamlining common interactions like "Y/N" confirmations and "continue" requests.

### State Detection (Complete)
Recognizes different states in the Claude interaction, including waiting, thinking, and responding, allowing for context-aware operations.

### Visual Aids (Complete)
Enhances the user interface with visual cues and formatting to improve readability and interaction with Claude responses.

### Interaction Limits (In Progress)
Implements safeguards to prevent excessive resource usage through rate limiting and interaction quotas.

## Advanced Features

### Yank As File (Complete)
Allows sending large text sections to Claude by automatically creating temporary files, addressing size limitations in terminal interactions.

### Buffer Management (Complete)
Provides tools for organizing and navigating between multiple Claude conversations and sessions.

### Templates (In Progress)
Standardized prompts and instructions that can be inserted into conversations to maintain consistency and enhance productivity.

### Notifications (In Progress)
Alert system to inform users about important events in Claude conversations, especially for long-running tasks.

## Infrastructure

### Variables & Configuration (Complete)
Central configuration system for customizing behavior and appearance across all components.

### Testing Framework (Complete)
Comprehensive suite of tests to ensure reliability and consistency of all features.

### Documentation (In Progress)
User and developer documentation including guides, examples, and reference materials.

## Bug Fixes

### Auto Response Timer (Complete)
Resolved issues with timing conflicts in the auto-response system that caused inconsistent behavior.

### Dashboard Buffer Visibility (Complete)
Fixed buffer visibility issues that caused the Claude dashboard to disappear or lose focus.

### Debug Message Control (Complete)
Implemented a configurable debug message system to help with troubleshooting while avoiding message clutter.

### Initial Waiting Detection (Complete)
Improved detection of Claude's initial waiting state to prevent premature responses.

## Component Relationships

The architecture follows a hierarchical design where:

1. State Detection provides foundational information to the Auto Response System
2. Visual Aids and Yank As File enhance the Term Claude Mode
3. Interaction Limits integrates with the Auto Response System
4. Templates and Notifications build upon the core infrastructure
5. Buffer Management works closely with Term Claude Mode

All components share the common configuration and variable system, ensuring consistent behavior throughout the application.

## Status Overview

- **Completed**: 12 components
- **In Progress**: 4 components
- **Pending**: 0 components

The project has made significant progress with most critical components completed. Current development is focused on enhancing user experience through advanced features while maintaining the stability of the core system.
