# Progress Report: Auto-Response Debugging
**Date**: 2025-05-31  
**Time**: 07:45 AM

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Auto-Response Mode-Line Indicator Stops Pulsing
- Created bug report documenting the issue
- Identified potential causes: timer conflicts, buffer-local issues
- Mode-line indicator should pulse continuously but stops after some time

### 2. Auto-Response Not Sending Responses
- User reported auto-response feature not working
- Multiple manual `/user:auto` commands sent by user
- Likely caused by state detection pattern mismatch

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Timer Refresh Function
Created `ecc-refresh-timers` function in `src/ecc.el`:
- Stops and restarts all ECC timers
- Handles global and buffer-local timers
- Updates mode-lines for all active buffers
- Available via `M-x ecc-refresh-timers`

### 2. Diagnostic Tools
Created diagnostic tools (provided in bug report):
- **diagnose-auto-response.el**: Comprehensive diagnostic showing buffer status, whitespace, hex dump
- **quick-prompt-check.el**: Quick prompt pattern checker
- Tools help identify pattern mismatches and special character issues

## Files Modified
1. `/src/ecc.el` - Added `ecc-refresh-timers` function
2. `/src/ecc-auto-response.el` - Added alias for refresh function
3. `/project_management/bug_reports/bug-report-auto-response-indicator-stops-pulsing.md` - Created comprehensive bug report
4. `/project_management/feature_requests/feature-request-ecc-refresh-timers.md` - Documented refresh feature
5. `/project_management/BULLETIN-BOARD.md` - Updated with current work status

## Next Steps
1. User should run diagnostic tools to identify actual Claude prompt format
2. Update state detection patterns based on diagnostic results
3. Implement more robust timer management
4. Add automatic timer health checks
5. Consider refactoring state detection to be more flexible

## Temporary Workaround
Users experiencing issues can use `M-x ecc-refresh-timers` to restart all timers and potentially restore functionality.
