## Analysis

### Improvements Since Last Check
- Increased passing rate from ~25% to 60%
- All major stable versions now passing
- Latest snapshot version passing

### Known Issues
The failures are all due to the kelleyk/emacs PPA not supporting Ubuntu Noble (24.04):
```
E: The repository 'https://ppa.launchpadcontent.net/kelleyk/emacs/ubuntu noble Release' does not have a Release file.
```

### Mitigation
- These versions are marked as `continue-on-error` in the workflow
- They don't block the merge or indicate code issues
- Will be resolved when PPA adds Ubuntu 24.04 support

## Conclusion
**CI Status: ACCEPTABLE** ✅

All critical Emacs versions (27.2, 28.1, 29.2-29.4, snapshot) are passing. The failing versions have known infrastructure issues unrelated to our code.

## Recommendation
**PROCEED WITH MERGE** - CI results confirm code quality and compatibility.
