# Emacs Claude Code - Sprint Plan (May 20 - June 3, 2025)

## Sprint Goals

1. Complete interaction limits implementation
2. Advance template system to 75% completion
3. Begin notifications framework implementation
4. Fix any newly identified bugs
5. Update documentation for recent changes

## Task Breakdown

## Dependencies

- Interaction limits must be completed before notification priority system
- Template variables depend on template selection UI completion
- Documentation updates should follow feature implementation

## Sprint Capacity

- Total available days: 10 working days
- Team capacity: TBD engineer-days
- Planned work: 31.5 engineer-days
- Buffer for unexpected issues: 20% (6.3 days)

## Success Criteria

1. All high-priority tasks completed
2. At least 50% of medium-priority tasks completed
3. All new code covered by tests
4. Documentation updated for all completed features
5. No regression in existing functionality

## Daily Standup

Daily standup meetings will be held at 10:00 AM to track progress and identify blockers.
