# Progress Report: Auto-Response System Improvements
Date: 2025-05-31

## Summary
Enhanced auto-response reliability through better state detection and safety mechanisms.

## Work Completed

### 1. Bug Fixes
- Fixed timer lambda argument mismatch errors
- Resolved syntax errors in auto-response and notification modules
- All 91 tests passing

### 2. Feature Requests Created

#### a. Multi-Buffer Split View
- Interactive buffer selection from list
- Dedicated command for auto-response dashboard
- Integration with emacs-tab-manager

#### b. Incomplete Auto-Response Sending
- Text verification before sending
- Chunked insertion for reliability
- Send confirmation loops

#### c. State-Based Verification
- Utilize `:running` state as send confirmation
- Track send states: pending → sending → sent → verified
- Enable intelligent retry logic

#### d. Centralized Keyword Detection
- Organize safety keywords like state patterns
- Multi-layer safety architecture
- Unified decision function

## Key Insights

### Two-Stage Decision Process
```
Stage 1: WHAT to send (from prompt detection)
Stage 2: WHETHER to send (safety checks)
```

### Multi-Layer Safety Architecture
```
State Detection → Safety Keywords → Throttling → Accumulation → Verification
```

### Critical Keywords
- **Running State**: "esc to interrupt"
- **Safety Indicators**: Processing, error, warning keywords
- **Completion Indicators**: Message sent, command executed

## Next Steps
1. Implement centralized keyword system
2. Add send verification using state transitions
3. Create multi-buffer dashboard view
4. Improve text insertion reliability

## Impact
These improvements will make auto-response more reliable, predictable, and debuggable, reducing manual intervention needs.
