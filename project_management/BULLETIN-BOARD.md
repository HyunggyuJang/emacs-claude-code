## 2025-05-31 07:55 AM
- Created temporary fixes for auto-response:
  1. `ecc-state-detection-patch.el` - More aggressive pattern matching
  2. `fix-auto-response.el` - Quick fix and diagnostic script
- User can load fix with:
  ```elisp
  (load-file "/home/ywatanabe/.dotfiles/.emacs.d/lisp/emacs-claude-code/fix-auto-response.el")
  ```
- This should restore auto-response functionality
