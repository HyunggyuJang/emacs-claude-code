## 📋 Implementation Details

### Buffer-Local State Module
The `ecc-buffer-state.el` module provides a robust state container that enables:
- Per-buffer state tracking using buffer-local hash tables
- Independent throttling and history tracking for each buffer
- Clear state predicates and manipulation functions

### Background Detection Engine
The `ecc-background-detection.el` engine implements:
- Timer-based background processing of registered buffers
- Cursor-independent state detection with save-excursion
- Chunked processing for performance optimization

### Shared Utilities
Two critical utility modules were created:
1. `ecc-vterm-utils.el` - Centralizes all vterm interaction
2. `ecc-debug-utils.el` - Provides standardized debugging facilities

### Integration Points
- The `ecc-auto-response-buffer-local.el` module ties everything together
- Original `ecc-auto-response.el` was updated to use the new utilities
- All systems maintain backward compatibility

## 🔍 Code Quality Improvements

### Duplication Removal
- Eliminated redundant vterm send functions
- Consolidated debug message handling
- Standardized buffer handling patterns

### Interface Standardization
- Consistent parameter ordering (buffer first)
- Standard debug function creation pattern
- Uniform error handling across modules

### Documentation Enhancements
- Added comprehensive module-level documentation
- Included detailed function descriptions
- Created design documents explaining architecture

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. **Comprehensive Testing** - Add more test cases for edge conditions
2. **User Interface** - Develop config interface for buffer-local settings
3. **Documentation** - Update user-facing documentation
4. **Integration** - Ensure seamless integration with other Claude Code features
