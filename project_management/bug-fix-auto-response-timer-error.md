# Auto-Response Timer Error Bug Fix

## Root Cause Analysis

After analyzing the code, I've identified the root cause of the auto-response timer error:

1. In `ecc-auto-response-fix.el`, the function `ecc-check-and-respond-advised` is defined with an `orig-fun` parameter:
   ```elisp
   (defun ecc-check-and-respond-advised (orig-fun)
     "Advice around `ecc-check-and-respond' to add throttling.
   ORIG-FUN is the original function."
     ...)
   ```

2. However, this function is applied using `:override` advice:
   ```elisp
   (advice-add 'ecc-check-and-respond :override
               #'ecc-check-and-respond-advised)
   ```

3. When using `:override` advice, the original function is completely replaced, not called, so the function should not take the original function as a parameter.

4. When the timer calls `ecc-check-and-respond`, it calls it with zero arguments, but the advised function expects one argument, causing the "wrong number of arguments" error.

## Solution Approach

The fix is straightforward:

1. Modify `ecc-check-and-respond-advised` to remove the `orig-fun` parameter since it's using `:override` advice, not `:around` advice.

2. This will make the function compatible with the way it's being called by the timer (with no arguments).

## Implementation

Here's the specific change required:

```elisp
;; Change this:
(defun ecc-check-and-respond-advised (orig-fun)
  "Advice around `ecc-check-and-respond' to add throttling.
ORIG-FUN is the original function."
  ...)

;; To this:
(defun ecc-check-and-respond-advised ()
  "Override implementation of `ecc-check-and-respond' with throttling."
  ...)
```

The function docstring should also be updated to reflect that it's an override implementation, not an advice that calls the original function.

## Testing Plan

1. Apply the fix to `ecc-auto-response-fix.el`
2. Start auto-response with `(ecc-start-auto-response)`
3. Verify that the timer runs without errors
4. Test with various Claude prompt states to ensure responses are still sent correctly
5. Test the throttling functionality to make sure it still works after the fix
