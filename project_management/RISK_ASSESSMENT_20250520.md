# Emacs Claude Code - Risk Assessment (May 20, 2025)

## Current Project Risks

This document identifies potential risks to project success and outlines mitigation strategies.

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Risk Score | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Claude API changes | Medium | High | High | Implement abstraction layer for API interactions; monitor announcements |
| Performance issues with large responses | Medium | Medium | Medium | Implement chunked processing; optimize rendering |
| Browser integration complexity | Medium | Medium | Medium | Start with proof-of-concept; consider phased approach |
| Compatibility across Emacs versions | High | Medium | High | Test on multiple Emacs versions; use feature detection |
| Memory leaks in long-running sessions | Low | High | Medium | Implement memory monitoring; aggressive garbage collection |

### Schedule Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Risk Score | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Template system complexity | Medium | Medium | Medium | Simplified MVP first; iterate with user feedback |
| Notification system delays | Low | Low | Low | Consider third-party libraries; phased implementation |
| Documentation falling behind | High | Medium | High | Integrate doc writing into development workflow |
| Unexpected bugs in core features | Medium | High | High | Increase test coverage; incremental releases |
| Scope creep | High | Medium | High | Maintain strict prioritization; defer non-essential features |

### User Adoption Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Risk Score | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Complex configuration | Medium | High | High | Provide sensible defaults; interactive setup |
| Learning curve too steep | Medium | High | High | Create quick-start guide; tutorial videos |
| Competing solutions | Low | Medium | Low | Focus on unique value proposition; integrate with ecosystem |
| Poor error handling | Medium | High | High | Implement user-friendly error messages; recovery mechanisms |
| Performance expectations | Medium | Medium | Medium | Set realistic expectations; optimize critical paths |

## Risk Monitoring

The following metrics will be tracked to detect emerging risks:

1. **Bug Report Rate**: Sudden increases indicate quality issues
2. **User Feedback Sentiment**: Negative trends require investigation
3. **Performance Metrics**: Degradation suggests optimization needs
4. **Feature Completion Velocity**: Slowdowns may impact schedule
5. **Test Coverage**: Decreases raise quality concerns

## Contingency Plans

### High Priority Risks

1. **Claude API Changes**:
   - Maintain emergency response team
   - Document API dependencies
   - Create abstraction layers

2. **Compatibility Issues**:
   - Prepare version-specific branches
   - Implement feature detection
   - Document minimum requirements

3. **Documentation Gaps**:
   - Dedicate resources to documentation
   - Implement documentation testing
   - Create user-contributed documentation process

### Early Warning Signs

1. Increased bug reports related to specific features
2. Degraded performance in benchmarks
3. Missed sprint goals
4. Decreased test coverage
5. Negative user feedback patterns

## Risk Reassessment Schedule

This risk assessment will be updated:
- At the beginning of each sprint
- When major features are completed
- When significant issues are discovered
- Quarterly for comprehensive review
