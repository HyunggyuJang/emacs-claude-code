# Test Plan for Consolidated Term-Claude Modules

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive test plan for the newly consolidated term-claude modules. The goal is to ensure each module functions correctly, both independently and as part of the integrated system.

## Test Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: For individual functions and features
2. **Integration Tests**: For interactions between modules
3. **Mock-Based Tests**: For functions that interact with external systems or have side effects
4. **Regression Tests**: To ensure existing functionality is preserved

## Test Coverage Goals

- Aim for â‰¥80% code coverage for each module
- 100% coverage for critical state detection functions
- Cover all public API functions and interactive commands

## Module-Specific Test Plans

  "Test sending arbitrary strings.")

(ert-deftest test-ecc-term-claude-follow-bottom ()
  "Test follow-bottom functionality.")
```

### 6. ecc-term-claude-performance.el

Test file: `tests/ecc-vterm/test-ecc-term-claude-performance.el`

Key focus areas:

  "Test GC optimization wrapper.")

(ert-deftest test-ecc-term-claude-get-state-optimized ()
  "Test optimized state detection.")
```

## Testing Approach

### Mocking Strategy

For testing functions that interact with the terminal or have side effects:

1. Use `cl-letf` to temporarily replace function definitions
2. Create stub/mock buffers with controlled content 
3. Track function calls to verify behavior

Example:
```elisp
(ert-deftest test-with-mock ()
  (let ((send-called nil))
    (cl-letf (((symbol-function 'vterm-send-string)
              (lambda (str) (setq send-called str))))
      (ecc-term-claude-send-yes)
      (should (equal send-called "y")))))
```

### Test Fixtures

1. Create standardized buffer fixtures for tests:
```elisp
(defun ecc-test-create-buffer-with-content (content)
  "Create a test buffer with CONTENT."
  (let ((buf (generate-new-buffer "*ecc-test*")))
    (with-current-buffer buf
      (insert content)
      (vterm-mode))
    buf))
```

2. Ensure proper cleanup:
```elisp
(unwind-protect
    (do-test-with-buffer buf)
  (kill-buffer buf))
```

## Test Execution Plan

1. Implement tests from most critical to least critical modules:
   - State detection (core functionality)
   - Auto-response (most visible user feature)
   - Setup (affects all other modules)
   - Performance (important but more isolated)

2. Run tests with increased verbosity during development:
```bash
emacs -Q --batch -L . -L src -L tests -l tests/ecc-vterm/test-ecc-term-claude-state.el --eval '(ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit)'
```

3. Incorporate into CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## Timeline

1. Week 1: Implement state and auto tests
2. Week 2: Implement setup and buffer tests
3. Week 3: Implement interaction and performance tests
4. Week 4: Integration tests and coverage analysis

## Conclusion

This test plan provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring the quality and reliability of the consolidated term-claude modules. By focusing on both unit and integration testing, we can verify the correct functioning of individual components as well as their interactions.
