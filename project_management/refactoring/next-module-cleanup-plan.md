# Module Cleanup Plan

## Summary

After successfully refactoring the buffer state and notification modules using clean code principles, we've identified several other modules that would benefit from similar treatment. This document outlines the next modules to refactor and the planned improvements.

## Priority Modules for Cleanup

1. **ecc-term-claude-mode.el**
   - **Issues**: Complex state detection logic, duplicate code for response sending, mixed responsibilities for UI and interaction logic
   - **Planned Improvements**:
     - Split state detection into smaller specialized functions
     - Extract duplicate response sending code into shared functions
     - Separate buffer management from interaction logic
     - Use the existing `ecc-notification` and `ecc-buffer-state` modules
     - Improve documentation with examples

2. **ecc-auto-response.el**
   - **Issues**: Mixed responsibilities, complex conditional logic, duplicate sending patterns
   - **Planned Improvements**:
     - Create a state-response mapping data structure
     - Extract common sending logic to helper functions
     - Better integrate with buffer state and notification modules
     - Add consistent error handling

3. **ecc-interaction-limiter.el**
   - **Issues**: Duplicate code in prompt functions, similar pattern matching in multiple places
   - **Planned Improvements**:
     - Create shared helper functions for limit checking
     - Consolidate duplicated code
     - Improve error handling for edge cases
     - Add better documentation

## Benefits of Continued Refactoring

1. **Code Quality**: More maintainable, easier to understand codebase
2. **Consistency**: Standard patterns and naming conventions across modules
3. **Reduced Duplication**: Helper functions and macros shared across modules
4. **Better Documentation**: Clear examples and function descriptions
5. **Improved Testability**: Smaller, focused functions are easier to test

## Implementation Approach

For each module:

1. **Analysis Phase**:
   - Review code for duplication and complexity
   - Identify shared patterns and responsibilities
   - Map dependencies and interactions

2. **Design Phase**:
   - Create constants for key values
   - Design helper functions and macros
   - Plan backward compatibility

3. **Implementation Phase**:
   - Refactor in small, testable steps
   - Add tests for key functionality
   - Maintain backward compatibility

4. **Verification Phase**:
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Documentation review
   - Performance checks

## Next Steps

1. Begin with `ecc-term-claude-mode.el` refactoring, using the same clean code principles applied to `ecc-buffer-state.el` and `ecc-notification.el`
2. Create tests for the module before and during refactoring
3. Document improvements in a refactoring report

This approach will continue to enhance the codebase's maintainability and reliability while preserving backward compatibility for existing functionality.
