# Bug Report: Auto-Response Mode-Line Indicator Stops Pulsing

## Description
When auto-response is enabled, the red [AUTO] indicator in the mode-line should pulse continuously. However, the pulsing effect stops after some time, though the feature itself continues to work.

## Expected Behavior
- The [AUTO] indicator should pulse continuously (alternating between bright red and dark red) as long as auto-response is enabled
- The pulsing should only stop when auto-response is disabled

## Actual Behavior
- The [AUTO] indicator initially pulses correctly when auto-response is enabled
- After some time, the pulsing stops, leaving the indicator in a static state
- Auto-response functionality continues to work despite the visual issue

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Enable auto-response with `C-c C-a` or `ecc-auto-toggle`
2. Observe the pulsing red [AUTO] indicator in the mode-line
3. Wait or interact with the buffer
4. Notice that the pulsing eventually stops

## Analysis
The issue appears to be related to the pulse timer management in `ecc-auto-response.el`. Potential causes:

1. **Timer conflicts**: The pulse timer might be getting cancelled by other operations
2. **Buffer-local timer issues**: The lambda function in the timer might lose reference to the correct buffer
3. **Mode-line update conflicts**: Other mode-line updates might interfere with the pulse timer
4. **Timer not being properly maintained**: The timer might need periodic refresh or recreation

## Relevant Code Locations
- `--ecc-auto-response--start-pulse-timer` in src/ecc-auto-response.el:436
- `--ecc-auto-response--update-mode-line` in src/ecc-auto-response.el:508
- Pulse timer implementation using buffer-local variables

## Additional Issue: Auto-Response Not Sending

The user reports that auto-response is not sending responses, in addition to the pulsing indicator issue.

### Possible Causes
1. **State detection failure**: The patterns might not match current Claude output format
2. **Already-sent detection**: The `--ecc-auto-response--already-sent-p` function might incorrectly think a response was already sent
3. **Throttling issues**: The throttle mechanism might be blocking legitimate responses
4. **Timer not running**: The main auto-response timer might have stopped
5. **Buffer registration**: The buffer might not be properly registered

### Debug Steps
1. Check if state detection is working: `(--ecc-state-detection-detect)`
2. Check if buffer is registered: `(gethash (current-buffer) --ecc-auto-response--registered-buffers)`
3. Check if timer is active: `--ecc-auto-response--timer`
4. Check throttle state: `--ecc-auto-response--last-time` and `--ecc-auto-response--last-state`
5. Enable debug mode: `(setq --ecc-debug-enabled t)`

## Diagnostic Tools Created

Two diagnostic tools have been created to help debug the issues:

1. **`diagnose-auto-response.el`** - Comprehensive diagnostic that shows:
   - Buffer and auto-response status
   - Last 500 characters with visible whitespace
   - Hex dump to identify special characters
   - Pattern matching results
   - Non-breaking space detection

2. **`quick-prompt-check.el`** - Quick prompt checker that shows:
   - Last 10 lines of buffer
   - Common pattern detection
   - Hex values for potential prompt lines

### Usage:
```elisp
;; Full diagnosis
(load-file "/home/ywatanabe/.dotfiles/.emacs.d/lisp/emacs-claude-code/diagnose-auto-response.el")
(ecc-diagnose-auto-response)

;; Quick check
(load-file "/home/ywatanabe/.dotfiles/.emacs.d/lisp/emacs-claude-code/quick-prompt-check.el")
```

## Temporary Workaround

The `ecc-refresh-timers` function has been implemented in `src/ecc.el`:
- Use `M-x ecc-refresh-timers` to restart all timers
- This can temporarily fix both the pulsing and auto-response issues

## Bug Fix Progress
- [x] Create diagnostic tools
- [x] Implement timer refresh function
- [ ] Identify root cause of timer stopping
- [ ] Fix auto-response not sending issue
- [ ] Update state detection patterns based on diagnostic results
- [ ] Implement robust timer management
- [ ] Add timer health checks
- [ ] Test with various buffer operations
- [ ] Ensure timer persists across mode-line updates
