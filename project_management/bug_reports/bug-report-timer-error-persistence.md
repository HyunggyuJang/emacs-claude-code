# Bug Report: Timer Lambda Error Persists After Fix

## Issue Description
The timer lambda argument mismatch error is still occurring even though the fix was committed:
```
Error running timer: (wrong-number-of-arguments #[nil ((if (buffer-live-p buf) (progn (save-current-buffer (set-buffer buf) (if --ecc-auto-response--enabled (progn (--ecc-auto-response--update-mode-line) (force-mode-line-update))))))) ((buf . #<buffer claude-31:48-80-01>))] 2)
```

## Root Cause
The fix was applied to the source code but the running Emacs instance is still using the old code. This indicates:
1. The package needs to be reloaded in Emacs
2. The user is running an older version of the code

## Solution
User needs to:
1. Update to latest code: `git pull origin develop`
2. Reload the package in Emacs:
   - `M-x eval-buffer` in `emacs-claude-code.el`
   - Or restart Emacs
   - Or `(unload-feature 'emacs-claude-code t)` then `(require 'emacs-claude-code)`

## Fix Already Applied
The fix was committed in: `717789a fix: Fix timer lambda argument mismatch in auto-response and notification modules`

Changed from:
```elisp
(run-with-timer 0.1 nil
                (lambda ()
                  (when (buffer-live-p buf)
                    ...)))
```

To:
```elisp
(run-with-timer 0.1 nil
                (lambda (buffer)
                  (when (buffer-live-p buffer)
                    ...))
                buf)
```

## Bug Fix Progress
- [x] Root cause identified
- [x] Fix implemented and committed
- [x] Tests pass
- [ ] User needs to reload package

## Additional Notes
- Also seen "Buffer is read-only: #<buffer *Messages*>" error
- This is unrelated - user tried to edit the *Messages* buffer
