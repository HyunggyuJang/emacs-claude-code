# Bug Report: Auto Command Accumulation

## Issue Description
The auto-response feature appears to be accumulating commands, potentially sending multiple responses when only one is expected. This could lead to unexpected behavior and excessive command execution.

## Symptoms
- Multiple auto commands being sent in quick succession
- Possible accumulation of "/user:auto" commands
- Unexpected repeated responses to the same prompt state

## Expected Behavior
- Auto-response should send only one response per detected state
- Proper throttling should prevent rapid-fire responses
- Clear state management between different prompt states

## Potential Causes
1. **Accumulation Detection Logic**: The accumulation detection mechanism might not be working correctly
2. **State Tracking**: The `--ecc-auto-response--already-sent-p` function might not be tracking sent positions accurately
3. **Timer Issues**: Multiple timer instances or improper timer management
4. **Buffer-local State**: Buffer-local variables might not be properly initialized or reset

## Affected Components
- `ecc-auto-response.el`
- Specifically the accumulation detection and throttling mechanisms

## Priority
High - This affects the usability and reliability of the auto-response feature

## Suggested Investigation Steps
1. Review the accumulation detection logic in `--ecc-auto-response--accumulation-detected-p`
2. Check the sent positions tracking in `--ecc-auto-response--already-sent-p`
3. Verify timer management to ensure no duplicate timers
4. Test with debug messages enabled to trace the execution flow

## Root Cause Found
The issue is in the `--ecc-auto-response--should-throttle-p` function:
- Line 321: It uses `(1+ recent-count)` which means it blocks when recent_count is 4 (since 4+1 >= 5)
- This allows only 4 responses in the window instead of 5
- The logic should be `(> recent-count --ecc-auto-response-accumulation-threshold)` to allow exactly 5 responses

## Bug Fix Progress
- [x] Identify root cause
- [ ] Fix the throttle logic
- [ ] Test the fix

## Related Configuration
- `--ecc-auto-response-throttle-duration` (default: 5.0 seconds)
- `--ecc-auto-response-accumulation-threshold` (default: 5)
- `--ecc-auto-response-accumulation-window` (default: 3.0 seconds)
