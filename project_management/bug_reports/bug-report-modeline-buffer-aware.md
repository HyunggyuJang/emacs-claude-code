# Bug Report: Modeline Not Working in Buffer-Aware Manner

## Summary
The AUTO indicator in the modeline was not properly buffer-local, causing modeline changes in one buffer to potentially affect other buffers.

## Description
The `--ecc-auto-response--update-mode-line` function was modifying `mode-line-format` without ensuring proper buffer-local isolation. This could lead to:
1. AUTO indicator appearing in wrong buffers
2. Modeline format corruption when enabling/disabling across multiple buffers
3. Shared mode-line-format structures being modified

## Root Cause
The function had several issues:
1. Did not ensure `mode-line-format` was buffer-local before modification
2. Used `delq` which modifies lists in-place, potentially affecting shared structures
3. Did not use `copy-sequence` when appending to existing mode-line-format

## Solution Implemented
Fixed in `src/ecc-auto-response.el`:

### Key Changes:
1. Added `make-local-variable 'mode-line-format` to ensure buffer-local modification
2. Used `copy-sequence` when appending to existing mode-line-format
3. Replaced `delq` with `cl-remove` to avoid in-place modification
4. Added comprehensive test case to verify buffer-local behavior

### Code Changes:
```elisp
(defun --ecc-auto-response--update-mode-line ()
  "Update mode-line to show auto-response status."
  ;; Ensure mode-line-format is buffer-local before modifying
  (make-local-variable 'mode-line-format)
  
  (if --ecc-auto-response--enabled
      ;; Add AUTO indicator to existing mode-line
      (unless (and (listp mode-line-format)
                   (member 'ecc-auto-indicator mode-line-format))
        ;; Create a new list to avoid modifying shared structures
        (setq mode-line-format
              (append '(ecc-auto-indicator) 
                      (if (listp mode-line-format)
                          (copy-sequence mode-line-format)
                        (list mode-line-format))))
        ;; ... rest of the function
```

## Test Coverage
Added `test-ecc-auto-response-modeline-buffer-local` test that:
- Creates two test buffers
- Enables auto-response in buffer 1, verifies buffer 2 is unaffected
- Enables auto-response in buffer 2
- Disables auto-response in buffer 1, verifies buffer 2 still has it enabled
- Ensures proper cleanup

## Impact
- **Fixed**: Modeline changes now properly isolated to individual buffers
- **Fixed**: No more cross-buffer contamination of mode-line-format
- **Fixed**: AUTO indicator appears only in buffers where explicitly enabled

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - All tests pass (48/48 tests, 100% pass rate)
