# Bug Report: State Detection Test Patterns Outdated

## Description
The state detection tests are failing because they use old patterns that don't match the current implementation.

## Current Issue
- Tests look for patterns like `[y/n]` and `[Y/y/n]`
- Actual implementation uses patterns like `❯ 1. Yes` and ` 2. Yes, and`

## Failed Tests
1. `test-ecc-state-detection-yn-pattern`
2. `test-ecc-state-detection-yyn-pattern`

## Root Cause
The state detection patterns were updated to match the new Claude interface, but the tests were not updated accordingly.

## Bug Fix Progress
- [x] Update test patterns to match current implementation
- [x] Verify tests pass - All 97 tests passing (100%)
- [ ] Consider making tests more resilient to interface changes

## Solution
Updated the test patterns in `test-ecc-state-detection.el`:
- Changed `[y/n]` pattern to `❯ 1. Yes`
- Changed `[Y/y/n]` pattern to `❯ 1. Yes\n 2. Yes, and`

This matches the current Claude interface patterns.
