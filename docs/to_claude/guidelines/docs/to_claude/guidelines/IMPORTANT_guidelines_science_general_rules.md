## Figure Rules
- Axes must have labels with units, ticks (n_ticks=3-5), and tick labels
- Ranges must not be misleading:
  - Bar graphs must start from 0
  - Variables within range [0, 1] should be displayed in [0, 1] range
- Figures are among the most important elements in science
  - Ensure all generated figures are scientifically valid
  - Consider aesthetic aspects as well
