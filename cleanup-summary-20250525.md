# Cleanup Summary - May 25, 2025

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Created Feature Branch
- Created `feature/cleanup-2025-0525-165507` for cleanup work
- Created checkpoint branch `checkpoint/before-cleanup-2025-0525-165507`

### 2. Test File Consolidation

#### Buffer State Tests (9 → 3 files)
**Removed files** (moved to `.old`):
- test-buffer-state-basic.el
- test-buffer-state-compatibility.el  
- test-buffer-state-detection-integration.el
- test-buffer-state-enhanced.el
- test-buffer-state-integration.el
- test-buffer-state-refactored.el
- test-buffer-state-snapshots.el
- test-buffer-local-state.el

**Created consolidated files**:
1. `test-buffer-state-core.el` - Core functionality tests
2. `test-buffer-state-detection.el` - Detection and snapshot tests
3. `test-buffer-state-features.el` - Features, compatibility, throttling tests

#### Debug Utils Tests (2 → 1 file)
**Removed files** (moved to `.old`):
- test-ecc-debug-utils.el (original)
- test-ecc-debug-utils-refactored.el

**Created consolidated file**:
- `test-ecc-debug-utils.el` - Combined all debug tests with single-assertion pattern

### 3. Other Cleanup
- Removed duplicate `tests/test-buffer-local-interactive.el` (kept version in `tests/interactive/`)
- Fixed syntax error in `test-buffer-local-system.el` (extra parenthesis)
- Fixed backward compatibility aliases in `ecc-variables.el` (defvar → defvaralias)

## Current Status

### Blocking Issue
Tests are failing because they require the `vterm` package which is not available in the test environment. The `ecc-term-claude-auto.el` module has an unconditional `(require 'vterm)`.

### Test Results Before vterm Issue
- Fixed all duplicate test definitions
- Fixed all syntax errors
- All consolidated test files properly require their dependencies
- Tests that don't depend on vterm should work correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Fix vterm dependency issue** - Either:
   - Make vterm requirement conditional with `(require 'vterm nil t)`
   - Skip vterm-dependent tests when vterm is not available
   - Mock vterm functions for testing

2. **Complete file naming standardization** (Low priority)
   - Review for any remaining development patterns (-v01, -fix, etc.)
   - Ensure all files follow clean production naming

3. **Merge cleanup branch** once tests pass

## Files Modified
- Multiple test files consolidated
- `src/ecc-variables.el` - Fixed backward compatibility aliases
- `tests/ecc-system/test-buffer-local-system.el` - Fixed syntax error

## Files Safely Removed
All removed files were moved to `.old` directories using `safe_rm.sh` for easy recovery if needed.
